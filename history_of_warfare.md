# John Keegan - History of Warfare

## Prehistory and Antique
- Primitive warfare was highly ritualised and usually didn’t result in high casualties. Warfare included getting victims for ritual sacrifice or raiding.
- Post agricultural revolution, peoples could be divided into civilised (farmers) and steppe/warrior (herders).
- Herders were more warlike as a result of being experienced with routing and killing animals.
- Chariot and composite bow revolutionised warfare by allowing steppe peoples to raid farmers practically uncontested.
- Chariot and composite bow were complex devices that emerged at the borders of civilisations.
- Steppe warfare was mostly evasive and relied heavily on missiles while civilised warfare was still ritualised.
- Chariot was ultimately replaced by cavalry which was made possible by selective horse breeding and the invention of a saddle.
- Greeks initialised “western warfare” by practicing pitched battles in a phalanx formation.
- Phalanx battles were bloody and terrifying compared to the evasive style of warrior peoples or ritualised warfare. 
- Participating warriors were members of a propertied class and sought to resolve issues in the quickest possible way.
- Main Roman contribution to warfare was the highly organised, professional officer corps of centurions.
- One of the reasons of Roman demise was the dissolution of a professional, standing army, which in turn disappeared because of lack of efficient taxation.

## Middle Ages
- Post-roman kingdoms fought wars with small groups of footed warriors organised around a king/chieftain who were self-maintained (living off looting and conquest).
- Once states became more stable and orderly, the need to maintain the warriors class in peaceful times resulted in the birth of feudalism. 
- With the invention of a stirrup, warrior class started adopting horses more widely.
- Horsed knights fought differently than horse peoples from the steppe - a charge of mounted knights with lances vs evasive tactics of steppe warriors.
- Islam conquest introduced the element of ideology to the western warfare.

## XVI-XVII
- The wide adoption of gunpowder made high-walled castles obsolete within few decades.
- Castles were replaced with bastion forts. Besieging such forts required more and more engineering expertise.
- Centralisation of power led to greater reliance on professional mercenary armies, which were more reliable and cheaper than knights.
- Firearms made heavily armoured knights obsolete. A cavalry charge could now be defended by a mixture of musketeers and pikeman.
- Military leaders experimented with the proportion between musketeers and pikeman.
- Infantry could defend agains cavalry, but could be shot down be field artillery. Artillery could be harassed by a cavalry change.

## XVIII
- Ability to maneuver groups of infantry became very important as well as the need for it to stand ground and the low frequency of musket fire. This led to an increased focus on foot drill. 
- Armies started becoming bigger due to significantly lower training cost for a musketeer.
- Armies were mostly recruited from the lowest layers of the society (unpropertied, second sons, etc.). For them, military service resembled a slave system.

## XIX
- Bayonetted musketeers made mixing pikemen with firearms obsolete.
- Previously, warfare was mostly limited to a small minority of the population. This was changed by the revolutions in XIX century, during which people were given rights in exchange for the obligation to fight.
- Armies became greater in numbers as the century progressed.
- The invention of a breech-loaded rifle vastly increased accuracy and firepower which combined with larger armies resulted in great casualties. The tactics didn’t account for these developments.

## WWI
- The trend of larger armies, bigger firepower and increased accuracy led to enormous casualties in WWI.
- Such a huge firepower led to much higher effectiveness of defensive vs offensive which in turn led to trench warfare.

## WWII
- Bliztkrieg promised to avoid the high casualty stalemates of the WWI trench warfare.
- Allies also started engaging large armoured formation which led to huge armoured battles.
- Strategic bombardment was supposed to cripple enemy’s industry and morale but wasn’t very effective.
